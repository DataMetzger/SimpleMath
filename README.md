Simple Math Performed in Various Programming Languages

There is nothing terribly special about this repo. In short, sometimes I don't like what is obfuscated when I use a library or other 
built in code from a language. I like to see the magic, or at least know what happened. So, as I have a few minutes, I will try to
document examples of the behind-the scenes code. However; to do some part of that I need to provide the building blocks and that is 
the stage I am at now. Soon I hope to outline my process and add it to this page.
